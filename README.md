# Put Your Data In Android a.k.a. Pydia!

Pydia! is a light client for [Pydio Cells](https://pydio.com).

It provides basic features to simply access and manage your files on your Android device.

## Geek corner

It is written in Kotlin and has for primary goal to serve as a playground and a sample project to start to learn Kotlin.
I am trying to stick to the best practices and use good patterns (still a work in progress :) )

You can find the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/bsinou/pydia), don't hesitate to star or fork.

### Third party libraries

Main libraries are: 

- The Pydio Cells SDK for Java
- AndroidX and JetPack
- AWS S3 Client for Android
- Glide

An complete list can be found in the main [build.gradle](https://github.com/bsinou/pydia/blob/main/build.gradle) file.
